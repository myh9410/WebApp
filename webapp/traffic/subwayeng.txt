There are many subway lines in Korea ranging from 1 to 9, including Airport Railroad, Gyeonggi Central Station, Shin Bundang and Bundang.
Among them, I will use only the 1st to 9th lines and the airport railway, so I will explain only this part.
All lines are color-coded. Line 1 is dark blue Line 2 is green Line 3 is orange Line 4 is light blue
Line 5 is purple. Line 6 is brown. Line 7 is dark green. Line 8 is pink. Line 9 is light brown.
Each station has its own number, the first number represents the line, and the last number represents the station order.
For example, 205 is the 5th stop on Route 2.
Also, there are unattended vending machines at all stations, which is difficult to use because foreigners are new to this.
So I prepared a video below to get a card and how to get a deposit refund.
If you look at the images, you will be able to access them more easily.
