As for the bus, the airport bus to and from Incheon International Airport and the Seoul City Tour
I just want to talk about the bus.
Airport buses are available to passengers arriving in Incheon right in front of the airport.
You can buy tickets and use them. Information on the limousine / seat bus at the bus ticket office on the first floor (arrival floor) of the passenger terminal (next to exit 4 and 9), outside (exit 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13 and 9C) You can get it,
You can buy the bus ticket.
I recommend bus 6015 which can go to Myeong-dong by recommended bus.
The Seoul City Tour Bus is a short bus to Seoul and has four courses.
This course is recommended for travelers who want to explore Seoul in a short time. For more information on the Seoul City Tour Bus
